## ðŸš€ Quick Context for New Chats

I'm building a SalesCoach app (sales training platform).
CURRENT STATE: Framework creation is FULLY WORKING âœ…

Next.js frontend + Express backend + Supabase

Backend: http://localhost:5000
Tenant ID: cd663ebb-a679-4841-88b0-afe1eb13bec8

WORKING FILES:

NEXT FEATURE TO BUILD: New Coaching Session Page

Background: Coach logging on to SalesCoach will select from an available pool of Coachees (Coachee Selector Tool tbd later). Starts new session with selected coach, which creates a Coaching Session record and opens Coaching Session Page. 
Coaching Session page consists of header incl. coach name, coachee name, date and time stamp. Coaching Context text entry box. Scoring section, pulling the sales framework and showing for each behavior in the framework a checkbox. checked = behavior shown, points accrued. Proficiency score is calculated for the framework, sub-scores per step. Under Scoring section, Coaching notes section consisting of 4 text entry boxes: key observations, what went well, what could be improved, action plan / next steps 
Coach can save or submit the session. Save = can still be edited. Submit = session is locked and can't be changed anymore. The page should autosave frequently so that no data gets lost.
