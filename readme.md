## Multi-Tenant Architecture ✅

### **Complete Tenant Isolation**
All core tables include `tenant_id` for proper multi-tenant security:
- ✅ **users**: Isolated by tenant
- ✅ **teams**: Isolated by tenant  
- ✅ **team_memberships**: Isolated by tenant
- ✅ **frameworks**: Isolated by tenant
- ✅ **coaching_sessions**: Isolated via user relationships

### **Security Model**
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with user tenant identification
- **API Security**: All routes filter by `req.user.tenant_id`
- **Data Isolation**: Users only see/modify data from their own tenant
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper database relationships with cascade deletes

### **Role Architecture**
#### System Roles (users.system_role):
- `admin` - Can access admin module, manage users/teams/frameworks
- `user` - Regular users who participate in coaching

#### Team Roles (team_memberships.team_role):
- `coach` - Can conduct coaching sessions with team members
- `coachee` - Receives coaching from coaches

**Coaching Permissions:**
- Coaches can only create sessions with coachees from their teams
- Self-coaching is always available (user coaches themselves)
- Team relationships determine coaching access

## Security Configuration

### **Multi-Tenant Security**
- **Tenant Isolation**: All database queries filtered by tenant_id
- **API Security**: Backend middleware validates tenant access
- **User Restrictions**: Users can only see/modify data from their own tenant
- **Admin Scope**: Admin users can only manage users/teams within their tenant
- **Coaching Permissions**: Users can only coach team members they're authorized for

### **Authentication Security**
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords secured with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- **JWT Tokens**: 24-hour expiration, secure token generation
- **Protected Routes**: Backend middleware validates all protected endpoints
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin features restricted to admin users only

### **Database Security**
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Currently DISABLED for development
  - ⚠️ **Note**: RLS is turned off to simplify development
  - **Production Todo**: Re-enable RLS with proper policies
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper relationships with CASCADE deletes
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated on backend

## Business Logic

### **🎯 Coaching Session Business Rules (NEW)**
- **Session Creation**: Coaches can create sessions with team members or self-coach
- **Team Validation**: System enforces coaching relationships via team memberships
- **Status Workflow**: Draft → Submitted → Locked (no reverse transitions)
- **Auto-Save**: Sessions auto-save every 2 seconds in draft mode
- **Data Persistence**: Unified scoring system handles both behavior and step-level data
- **Edit Restrictions**: Submitted sessions become permanently read-only
- **Delete Protection**: Only draft sessions can be deleted
- **Self-Coaching**: Always available regardless of team memberships

### **User Management Business Rules**
- **Soft Delete**: Users are deactivated (active = false) rather than deleted
- **Team Cleanup**: When user deactivated, team memberships are removed
- **Role Flexibility**: Users can be coaches in some teams, coachees in others
- **Admin Creation**: New users can be created with admin privileges
- **Email Uniqueness**: Email addresses must be unique across the entire system

### **Team Management Business Rules**
- **Multi-Role Assignment**: Users can have different roles in different teams
- **Membership Management**: Adding/removing members updates team displays in real-time
- **Clean Deletion**: Deleting teams removes all member assignments
- **Name Uniqueness**: Team names must be unique within a tenant
- **Member Flexibility**: Team composition can be updated at any time

### **Proficiency Scoring System**

#### **Core Principle**: Cumulative Point Thresholds
The scoring system uses cumulative point thresholds rather than percentages to determine proficiency levels.

#### **Point Calculation**:
- **Learner behaviors**: 1 point each
- **Qualified behaviors**: 2 points each  
- **Experienced behaviors**: 3 points each
- **Master behaviors**: 4 points each

#### **Threshold Logic**:
```
Given a step/substep with:
- A learner behaviors (max A points)
- B qualified behaviors (max B×2 points)  
- C experienced behaviors (max C×3 points)
- D master behaviors (max D×4 points)

Proficiency Levels:
- Learner: 0 to A points
- Qualified: (A + 1) to (A + B×2) points
- Experienced: (A + B×2 + 1) to (A + B×2 + C×3) points
- Master: (A + B×2 + C×3 + 1) to (A + B×2 + C×3 + D×4) points
```

#### **Manual Override System**:
- Coaches can manually override step-level proficiency via dropdown
- Manual overrides stored in same table as behavior scores
- Override values: 'Learner', 'Qualified', 'Experienced', 'Master'
- Both auto-calculated and manual scores preserved in database

## 🔧 Development Lessons Learned & Tips

### **Critical Database Schema Lessons**
⚠️ **Always verify actual database schema vs documentation**
- Documentation said `what_went_well` but database had `strengths`
- Column name mismatches caused silent failures
- **Tip**: Run `SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'table_name'` first

### **Backend Route Issues & Solutions**
⚠️ **Route order matters in Express**
- Generic routes like `/:sessionId` must come AFTER specific routes like `/:sessionId/save`
- **Tip**: Most specific routes first, generic routes last

⚠️ **upsert vs insert/update decisions**
- `upsert` requires unique constraints that may not exist
- **Tip**: Check constraints first or use explicit insert/update logic

### **Authentication Integration Patterns**
✅ **Successful Pattern**: Store token in localStorage as `auth_token`
✅ **AuthContext Pattern**: Provide `getToken()` method for consistent access
✅ **Middleware Pattern**: Use `requireAuth` middleware on all protected routes

### **Database Column Management Strategy**
✅ **Add columns with `IF NOT EXISTS`** to avoid errors
✅ **Use `updated_at` columns** for change tracking
✅ **Foreign key references** should be added after main columns exist

### **Data Structure Design Decisions**
✅ **Unified scoring table approach** (session_scores)
- Single table for both behavior scores AND step overrides
- `behavior_id` filled for behavior scores, null for step overrides  
- `step_id` + `step_level` filled for step overrides, null for behavior scores
- **Advantage**: Simpler queries, easier data management

### **Frontend State Management Patterns**
✅ **URL parameters for session context** - Clean, bookmarkable, SSR-friendly
✅ **Auto-save with debouncing** - Save 2 seconds after last change
✅ **Status-aware UI** - Disable forms based on session status

### **API Design Best Practices Applied**
✅ **Consistent error responses** with details object
✅ **Request/response logging** for debugging
✅ **Tenant validation** on every authenticated request
✅ **Status checks** before allowing modifications

### **Testing & Debugging Strategies**
✅ **Terminal logging** with clear markers (`=== SECTION ===`)
✅ **Database lag awareness** - Data may take seconds to appear
✅ **Manual API testing** via browser console when needed
✅ **Step-by-step verification** of each integration point

### **Multi-Tenant Architecture Insights**
✅ **Tenant isolation** via user relationships rather than direct tenant_id on session tables
✅ **Permission validation** through team memberships
✅ **Consistent filtering** by req.user.tenant_id across all admin APIs
